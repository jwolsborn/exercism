exercism exercises

My biggest issue was lack of rust functions available to me.  The ugliest solution I had was for say.  After finishing I did look
at some of the solutions and say much more elegant solutions to the problem.  Of course, to avoid plagarism, I didn't refactor my code
for say and left it as is.  I did learn that there is much more to the rust language than I thought and I can create some nice solutions
to these problems with a little more research.  Overall I felt like I was writing C code, but at least with the knowledge that I didnt
break the rust promises thus "ensuring" that my code was safe.
